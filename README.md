# Hand Sign Recognition Using Deep Neural Network
This repository contains my project on deep neural network model on dataset , [Hand_Sign](https://www.kaggle.com/ayanmaity/hand-sign/data) . 
The dataset consists of images of hand numeric signs . And the main objevtive of this project is to correctly predict what is the numeric sign depictedby the image . 

I used pytorch CNN model to create my first deep NN architecture in the first notebook. Then I switched to keras to flexibly build a simple 3 layer ResNet network that gets an accuracy of about 96.67 % on the test data .
